Procrastination Timer is a web and desktop productivity app built with Electron, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It tracks both your focus and procrastination time, and it WILL call you out when you slack off.

When you start a session, the fox comes to life, walking when your focus timer is running and crying when you pause it to continue procrastinating (so DONT). A clean interface lets you start, pause, and stop sessions easily, while pop-up messages appear when you stop or pause. This app will also save your streaks, calculates productivity scores, and logs session stats locally so you can watch your progress over time.

I built this app because I NEED TO LOCK IN. The hardest parts were syncing timers and animations across different app states, building a working focus mode window that remains visible no matter the app you're in, and really just setting up an Electron app proved to be a complex and challenging process.
